# Unlike regression where you predict a continuous number, you use classification to predict a CATEGORY of new observations based on training data. There is a wide variety of classification applications from medicine, marketing, business
# This is a type of supervised learning algorithm

# Example of Classification:
# We have customers of a business and we would like to predict which customers are more likely to stay/leave (churn modelling).
# Email: normal, urgent, promotion, spam -> gmail for eg is so good these days as they are using advance classifications algorithms
# Image recognition: separate dogs from cats from mixed image.
