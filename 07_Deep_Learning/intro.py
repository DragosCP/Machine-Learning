# Deep Learning can be used for a variety of complex tasks:

# Artificial Neural Networks for Regression and Classification
# Convolutional Neural Networks for Computer Vision
# Recurrent Neural Networks for Time Series Analysis
# Self Organizing Maps for Feature Extraction
# Deep Boltzmann Machines for Recommendation Systems
# Auto Encoders for Recommendation Systems

# In this course we will implement to following Deep Learning models:
# 1. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for a Business Problem
# 2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for a Computer Vision task
